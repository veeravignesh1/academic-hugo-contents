# Normalizing

Normalization is a process that converts a list of words to a more uniform sequence. This is useful in preparing text for later processing. By transforming the words to a standard format, other operations are able to work with the data and will not have to deal with issues that might compromise the process. For example, converting all words to lowercase will simplify the searching process.
